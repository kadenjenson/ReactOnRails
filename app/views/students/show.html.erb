<strong>TIMEFRAME TO COMPLETE THE COURSE</strong>
<aside>In order to receive a course grade and have your transcript reflect full credit for a class, all course requirements must be completed within a certain timeframe.</aside> 

<b>FAQ</b>
<aside>Q. What if I fail to finish on time?</aside>
<aside>A. You will still have access to the material after the normal timeline, but might not receive academic credit (if available to you) for the course.</aside> 
<br>
<aside>Q. Can I still get academic course credit later?</aside>
<aside>A. You may later pay a certification fee and have your learning individually assessed to receive credit, or retake the course at a later time. Acceptance of this by other institutions can not be guaranteed, as some academic institutions have strict attendance requirements. If you want to be eligible for potential academic transfer we strongly recommend you plan to finish courses on time.</aside> 
<br>
<aside>Q. What if I anticipate needing a bit of time off during the course?</aside>
<aside>A. Some “slack” has already been built into every course schedule to allow a reasonable amount of time for vacations, illness, and surprises, so the pace is not too difficult. This slack is estimated at about 20% of the schedule for part-time courses and only 10% for full-time courses. Do not plan to take time off during a full-time immersive course.</aside>
<br>
<aside>Q. How do I transfer my credits to a college?</aside>
<aside>A. When ready you may request your ACE credit recommendations transcript. More than 1,500 colleges and universities are members of ACE. Present your transcript to your desired transfer school(s). Be advised that admissions policies vary from one college to another and the receiving institution has discretion regarding how much credit they allow to transfer in.</aside>
